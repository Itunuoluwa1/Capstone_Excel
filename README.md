# Capstone Sales Data
## This is where I documented the Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
### Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
**Summary:** In this project, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.
##### Instructions:
**Excel:**

- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report.
